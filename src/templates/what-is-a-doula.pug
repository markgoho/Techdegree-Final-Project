    h2 What is a Doula?
    h3 Birth Doula
    p A birth doula is a woman who provides continuous physical, emotional and informational support to the mother before, during and just after childbirth.
    h3 Postpartum Doula
    p A postpartum doula helps a family make a smooth transition into parenthood by providing assistance with newborn care, breastfeeding, household duties and valuable emotional support during the postpartum period.
    h2 What does a doula do?
    p Doulas are trained in the use of comforting touch, breathing techniques, relaxation, positioning to enhance labor, as well as the anatomy and physiology of the childbirth process. A doula performs NO clinical tasks but does combine her care and wisdom with the skills and knowledge of nurses, midwives and physicians. A doula will also help her client self-advocate and she will support the motherâ€™s partner through the birth process.
